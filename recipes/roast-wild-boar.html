	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>A German wild boar roast, or Wildschweinbraten, is a hearty and flavorful dish traditionally enjoyed in
		German cuisine, especially during the autumn and winter months. The roast is typically marinated in a
		mixture of red wine, vinegar, and aromatic spices like juniper berries, bay leaves, and cloves, which
		tenderize the meat and enhance its robust, gamey flavor. It is slow-cooked to perfection, often served
		with rich gravy, red cabbage (Rotkohl), and potato dumplings (Klöße), making it a comforting and festive
		meal.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 ½ kg Wildschwein</li>
		<li>1 Bund Suppengrün</li>
		<li>1 Liter Rotwein</li>
		<li>1 Liter Buttermilch</li>
		<li>2 Lorbeerblätter</li>
		<li>6 Wacholderbeere(n)</li>
		<li>3 Pfefferkörner</li>
		<li> Salz</li>
		<li> Nelkenpfeffer</li>
		<li> Rosmarin, getrocknet</li>
		<li>4 EL süße Sahne</li>
		<li>1 EL Gelee (Johannisbeer-)</li>
		<li>2 EL Butter</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Preparation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Preparation time: approx. 40 minutes</li>
		<li>Cooking time: about 2 hours</li>
		<li>Total time: approx. 2:40 hours</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Soak the wild boar meat overnight in buttermilk, along with a bay leaf, 3 juniper berries, and 3 crushed
		peppercorns.</p>
	<p>The next day, remove the meat from the buttermilk, pat it dry, and rub it with salt, pepper, and a little
		dried rosemary. Sear the meat briefly on all sides in butter along with the finely chopped soup
		vegetables (carrot, celery, onion, leek). Then deglaze with red wine. Add salt, pepper, a bay leaf, and
		juniper berries. Cover and braise in the oven for about 2 hours at 200°C (392°F).</p>
	<p>Once the meat is tender, remove it and let it rest wrapped in aluminum foil for 10 minutes. During this time,
		puree the red wine sauce with about 2-3 tablespoons of the soup vegetables. Adjust the flavor with salt,
		pepper, and redcurrant jelly to taste. Finally, stir in the cream.</p>
	<p>Slice the meat and serve with the sauce, red cabbage (Blaukraut), and dumplings (Klöße).</p>
