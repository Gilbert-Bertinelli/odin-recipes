		Germany. It's a tangy, slightly spicy dish made with a variety of meats (such as sausage, ham, or beef),
		pickles, tomatoes, and a rich, sour broth, typically flavored with smoked paprika, bay leaves, and
		sometimes olives. The soup is known for its bold combination of sour, salty, and savory flavors, and
		it's often served with a dollop of sour cream and fresh herbs.</p>
