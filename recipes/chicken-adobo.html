	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Chicken adobo is a popular Filipino dish made by simmering chicken in a savory and tangy marinade of soy
		sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. The dish is typically cooked until the
		chicken is tender and the flavors are well-blended, often served with rice. It's known for its bold,
		rich taste, with a perfect balance of salty, sour, and savory flavors.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>¾ cup white wine vinegar</li>
		<li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
		<li>8 garlic cloves</li>
		<li>½ tsp black peppercorns</li>
		<li>3 bay leaves</li>
		<li>1 heaping tbsp brown sugar</li>
		<li>8 chicken thighs</li>
		<li>3 spring onions, thinly sliced</li>
		<li>Oil for frying</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Preparation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Prep time: 15 minutes</li>
		<li>Rest time: 15 minutes</li>
		<li>Cooking time: 30 minutes</li>
		<li>Total time: 1 hour</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In a large bowl, mix the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, and brown sugar well. Add the
		chicken thighs, toss them in the marinade, and let them marinate for about 15 minutes.</p>

	<p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Shake off any excess marinade from the chicken
		thighs. Fry the chicken thighs in the pan for about 5 minutes on each side, then remove from the pan.
	</p>

	<p>Pour the remaining marinade into the pan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, add the chicken thighs back to
		the pan, and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn the chicken thighs, stirring occasionally, and continue to
		simmer until the sauce has reduced by half and thickened, about 10 more minutes.</p>

	<p>Serve the chicken thighs sprinkled with spring onions and with rice on the side.</p>
